# V R Cubes
A dumb, weird multiplayer VR toy. V R all cubes, V can move around, and V can set R own textures by pasting in URLs. That's pretty much it.

[Try it!](http://okaybenji.itch.io/v-r-cubes)

NOTE: Use image URLs which begin with `https`.

# Why?
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

This is maybe the first multiplayer WebVR thing? And/or maybe the first game-like thing to let you texture yourself with a URL? If you know of others, please [get in touch](http://twitter.com/okaybenji)!
